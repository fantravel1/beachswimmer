# BEACHSWIMMER.COM — README (v1)
**The world’s best beaches for real swimming.**  
**Not just beautiful — swimmable.**

BeachSwimmer is not a generic beach website.

It is a **swimming-first beach intelligence system** built for people who actually get in the water and care about:

- water feel
- entry safety
- clarity
- depth
- temperature
- wind + swell behavior
- swim-type match (lagoon vs open ocean vs wave swim)

This README defines the **non-negotiable philosophy, structure, and rules** for the BeachSwimmer mega-site.

---

## 0) The Core Truth (The Reframe)

### Not all beaches are swimmable.

A beach can be famous and still be:

- too rough  
- too cold  
- too rocky  
- too dirty  
- too shallow  
- too dangerous  

BeachSwimmer exists to say:

> **“Yes — you can actually swim here. And it’s incredible.”**

This is the moat.

---

## 1) What BeachSwimmer Is (and Is Not)

### BeachSwimmer IS:
- a global directory of **swimmable beaches**
- a **SwimScore™ rating system**
- a **swim-type discovery engine**
- a **swim-first travel planning tool**
- a high-trust authority with a consistent voice

### BeachSwimmer is NOT:
- a blog  
- a resort/luxury site  
- an influencer photo gallery  
- a generic “Top 10 beaches” list factory  
- a fear-based safety site  
- a wave-surf-only culture site  

If a page reads like a travel magazine, it’s wrong.

---

## 2) The Site’s 3 Primary Pillars

Everything on the site must support one of these three pillars:

### A) Beach Pages (the core unit)
Every beach has one canonical page with SwimScore™ and swim intelligence.

### B) Swim-Type Browsing
People don’t want the “best beach.”  
They want the **right swim** for their body, mood, and ability.

### C) Swim-First Travel Planning
Every beach page must support a traveler making a real decision:
- where to stay
- how to access the swim
- what conditions make it great or dangerous

---

## 3) SwimScore™ (The Signature IP)

### SwimScore™ is the core product.
Every beach gets a score from **1–100**.

This score is not a vibe.
It is a structured evaluation of swimming quality.

### SwimScore™ factors (canonical list)
Every beach must be evaluated on:

- **Water Clarity**
- **Safety** (rips, surf, hazards)
- **Entry Ease** (sand vs rocks, cliffs, ladders)
- **Depth Quality** (how quickly it becomes swimmable)
- **Temperature Comfort**
- **Crowding**
- **Cleanliness**
- **Marine Life** (good vs dangerous)
- **Calmness vs Waves** *(tagged, not judged)*

### SwimScore™ philosophy
- Safety can override beauty.
- Clarity can override popularity.
- Entry matters more than people admit.
- A beach can be incredible but still not for beginners.
- “Swimmable” means: **a human can reasonably enter, move, float, and enjoy the water.**

---

## 4) Swim Types (How People Actually Search)

Swim types are first-class objects on the site.

**Canonical Swim Types:**

- Calm Lagoon Swim  
- Open Ocean Swim  
- Big Wave Swim *(advanced only)*  
- Snorkel Swim  
- Cliff-Entry Swim  
- Long-Distance Swim  
- Family Swim  
- Cold Water Swim  
- Warm Water Swim  

### Rule
A beach page must be tagged with **at least one swim type** and **no more than three**.

---

## 5) The Mega-Site Architecture (Non-Negotiable)

This site scales by structured hubs + canonical beach pages.

### A) Country Hubs
Example:
- Best swimming beaches in Greece

URL:
```
/countries/greece/
```

### B) Island / Region Hubs
Example:
- Best swimming beaches in Mallorca

URL:
```
/regions/mallorca/
```

### C) City Proximity Hubs (“Swim Cities”)
Example:
- Best swimming beaches near Barcelona

URL:
```
/cities/barcelona/swimming-beaches/
```

### D) Beach Pages (the core)
URL:
```
/beaches/<beach-name>/
```

### E) Swim Guides
URL:
```
/guides/
```

---

## 6) The Canonical Beach Page Template (Exact Order)

Every beach page must follow this structure.

### Above the Fold (Required)
- Beach name + country/region
- SwimScore™ (1–100)
- Swim types (tags)
- One-line truth statement (no fluff)

Example:
> “Crystal-clear lagoon swim with safe sand entry — best in low wind.”

### Section 1 — The Swim (Plain English)
- What it feels like
- What kind of swim it is
- Who it’s best for

### Section 2 — Safety Reality
- Rip current risk
- Surf behavior
- Hidden hazards (rocks, reefs, boat zones, jellyfish)

Tone:
> confident, calm, factual

### Section 3 — Entry Type

- Shallow vs deep
- How quickly it becomes “real swimming”

### Section 5 — Temperature + Comfort

### Section 6 — Swim Weather (Signature Feature)
This is the differentiator.

Must include:
- Wind direction effects

- Rain runoff impacts

### Section 7 — Best Months to Swim

### Section 8 — Crowding + Vibe
- When it’s crowded

- fish presence
- hazards

### Section 10 — Who It’s For / Who Should Avoid
Two bullet lists. Always.

### Section 11 — Getting There
- nearest airport
- drive time
- ferry routes
- parking notes

### Section 12 — Where to Stay (Swim-First)

## 7) Swim Guides (Authority Without Fear)

Swim guides exist to teach competence without killing joy.

### Examples (canonical)
- How to spot rip currents
- What to do if caught in a rip
- Wind and swell basics
- Jellyfish seasons
- Sea urchin avoidance
- Coral-safe sunscreen rules
- Cold water shock: what it is and how to handle it

### Tone rule
No fear-mongering.  
No macho energy.  
No “you’ll die.”

BeachSwimmer is competence, not panic.

---

## 8) The Clean Water List (Viral, but True)

A global list of beaches famous for:

- crystal clarity
- minimal runoff
- protected coves
- exceptional visibility

URL:
```
/lists/clean-water/
```

This list must be curated carefully.
It is a trust asset.

---

## 9) The World Swim Bucket List (Evergreen Flagship)

These pages are evergreen and must be maintained as the “front door” SEO magnets.

Examples:
- Top 50 swimming beaches on Earth
- Top 25 calmest beaches
- Top 25 clearest water beaches
- Top 25 warmest water beaches
- Top 25 most dramatic swim entries
- Top 25 best beaches for kids swimming

URL:
```
/lists/
```

---

## 10) Swim-First Travel Planning (Monetization Layer)

BeachSwimmer monetizes by helping swimmers travel better.

Every beach page must include:
- nearest airport
- realistic drive time
- ferry notes (if relevant)
- where to stay for swim access
- safety notes that affect trip planning

This creates natural monetization opportunities:
- lodging affiliates
- swim gear (minimal, curated)
- local tour operators (snorkel/boat access)
- airport transfers

### Rule
Monetization must never compromise trust.

If the site feels like a sales funnel, it dies.

---

## 11) The Swimmer Personality Quiz (Sticky Growth)

This is a social growth engine.

Examples:
- The Lagoon Lover
- The Wave Charger
- The Snorkel Swimmer
- The Cold Plunger
- The Sunset Floater
- The Long-Distance Beast

The quiz output must:
- recommend swim types
- recommend destinations
- link to hub pages

URL:
```
/quiz/
```

---

## 12) Editorial Voice (Non-Negotiable)

BeachSwimmer must sound:

- clean
- ocean-literate
- swimmer-athletic
- joyful
- confident
- respectful of nature

Avoid:
- luxury language (“exclusive,” “elite resort”)
- influencer language (“Instagrammable”)
- generic travel blog tone
- overly poetic writing

Preferred tone:
> “We know water. We know swims. Here’s the truth.”

---

## 13) Design Rules (Look + Feel)

BeachSwimmer should feel like:

- a swimmer’s tool
- a nature atlas
- a clean guidebook

Visual rules:
- white backgrounds
- strong typography
- calm spacing
- minimal photography
- maps, icons, and condition tables over glamour shots

Not:
- resort ads
- influencer selfies
- luxury layouts

---

## 14) Why This Can Be Huge

Because it intersects:

- wellness travel
- family travel
- adventure travel
- safety decisions
- climate-driven travel planning
- ocean obsession

And it scales forever globally.

---

## 15) Long-Term Expansion (The Michelin Guide of Swims)

BeachSwimmer can eventually become:

- annual awards
- SwimScore™ certification
- “Best New Swim Beaches”
- “Best Protected Swims”
- “Best Winter Sun Swims”

This is the natural endgame.

---

## 16) The One Rule That Protects Everything

**BeachSwimmer only exists if it stays honest.**

If a beach is beautiful but not safe to swim, the site must say so.

That honesty is the brand.
That honesty is the moat.
That honesty is why it wins.
