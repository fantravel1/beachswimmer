        <h2 id="faq-heading">Barcelona Swimming FAQ</h2>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can you swim at Barcelona city beaches?</summary>
          <p>Yes. Barceloneta, Nova Icària, and Bogatell are all swimmable city beaches with lifeguards, flag systems, and decent water quality. The water is cleaner than most people expect. For the best city swim, Nova Icària is calmer and less crowded than Barceloneta.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Where are the best swimming beaches near Barcelona?</summary>
          <p>The best swims are on the Costa Brava, 1–2 hours north by car or train. Tossa de Mar, Sa Tuna, and Aiguablava offer crystal-clear cove swimming that rivals the Greek islands. By train, Sitges (35 minutes south) offers clean, calm beach swimming closer to the city.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>When is the best month to swim at Barcelona beaches?</summary>
          <p>June through September, with water temperatures of 22–26°C. September is the sweet spot — warm water, fewer tourists, and calmer seas. Avoid swimming after heavy rain, as urban runoff temporarily reduces water quality.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is the water clean at Barcelona beaches?</summary>
          <p>Barcelona city beaches consistently meet EU bathing water quality standards. Water is tested daily during swim season. Quality dips temporarily after heavy rain due to urban runoff — wait 24–48 hours after a storm before swimming. Costa Brava coves have consistently excellent water quality.</p>
