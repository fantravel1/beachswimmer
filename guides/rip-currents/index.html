          <h2 id="what-heading">What Is a Rip Current</h2>
          <p>A rip current is a narrow channel of fast-moving water that flows from shore out to sea. It forms when water pushed onto the beach by waves needs a way back out. That return flow concentrates through gaps in sandbars, between rocks, or alongside structures like piers and jetties.</p>
          <p><strong>Key facts:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rips do not pull you under. They pull you away from shore.</li>
            <li>Most rips are 10–30 meters wide.</li>
            <li>They typically extend 50–100 meters offshore, weakening beyond the breaking zone.</li>
            <li>Rip speeds range from 0.5 to 2.5 m/s — faster than most swimmers.</li>
            <li>They form and dissolve with changing wave and tide conditions.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="spot-heading">
          <h2 id="spot-heading">How to Spot a Rip Current from Shore</h2>
          <p>Spend 2 minutes watching the water from an elevated position before entering. Look for these visual cues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>A channel of darker, calmer water</strong> between areas of breaking white waves. The rip looks "flat" compared to the surf around it.</li>
            <li><strong>A line of foam, seaweed, or debris</strong> flowing steadily seaward.</li>
            <li><strong>Discolored or churned-up water</strong> — sand being carried offshore creates a brown or murky streak.</li>
            <li><strong>A gap in the wave pattern</strong> — waves break on the sandbar on either side but not in the rip channel.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you see any of these signs, do not enter the water in that zone. Move 50+ meters along the beach to where waves are breaking evenly.</p>

        <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="escape-heading">
          <h2 id="escape-heading">What to Do If Caught in a Rip</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Stay calm.</strong> Panic causes drowning, not the rip itself. You will not be pulled under.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not swim directly toward shore.</strong> You cannot outswim the current. Even Olympic swimmers cannot fight a strong rip head-on.</li>
            <li><strong>Swim parallel to the beach.</strong> Move sideways until you feel the pull weaken. Most rips are narrow — 20–30 meters of lateral swimming will get you out.</li>
            <li><strong>Swim back at an angle.</strong> Once free of the rip, swim diagonally toward shore, angling away from the rip channel.</li>
            <li><strong>If exhausted, float.</strong> Roll onto your back, spread your arms, and float. Raise one arm to signal for help. The rip will carry you to where it weakens, and you can recover before swimming back.</li>
          </ol>

        <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="risk-heading">
          <h2 id="risk-heading">Which Beaches Have the Most Rip Currents</h2>
          <p>Rip currents are most common at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Long, open surf beaches</strong> with sandbars (Atlantic coast, Australian beaches, Pacific coast)</li>
            <li><strong>Beaches with jetties, piers, or rock groynes</strong> that channel water flow</li>
            <li><strong>Beaches after storms</strong> when sandbars have shifted</li>
            <li><strong>Beaches at low tide</strong> when sandbars are most exposed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Rip currents are <strong>rare or absent</strong> at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sheltered coves and lagoons</li>
            <li>Calm Mediterranean calas</li>
            <li>Beaches with minimal wave action</li>
            <li>Reef-protected beaches</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Every BeachSwimmer beach page includes a rip current risk rating in the Safety Reality section.</p>

        <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="myths-heading">
          <h2 id="myths-heading">Common Myths</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>"Rips pull you under."</strong> No. They pull you out, not down. You can always breathe.</li>
            <li><strong>"Strong swimmers don't get caught."</strong> Wrong. Rips are faster than most swimmers. Strength doesn't help if you fight the current — technique does.</li>
            <li><strong>"Rip tides."</strong> The common name is misleading. Rips are caused by wave action, not tides. The correct term is rip current.</li>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What is a rip current?</summary>
            <p>A rip current is a narrow channel of fast-moving water that flows from shore out to sea. It forms when water pushed onto the beach by waves funnels back out through a gap in a sandbar or between rocks. Rip currents do not pull you under — they pull you away from shore.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What should you do if caught in a rip current?</summary>
            <p>Stay calm and do not fight it by swimming directly back to shore. Swim parallel to the beach until you exit the rip channel (usually 10–30 meters wide), then swim back to shore at an angle. If you cannot swim out, float on your back and signal for help.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How do you spot a rip current from shore?</summary>
            <p>Look for: a channel of darker, calmer water between breaking waves; a line of foam, debris, or discolored water flowing seaward; a gap in the wave pattern where waves are not breaking. Stand elevated and watch the water for 2 minutes before entering.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can rip currents kill you?</summary>
            <p>Rip currents themselves do not kill — drowning from exhaustion and panic does. If you stay calm, float when tired, and swim parallel instead of fighting the current, you can survive any rip. Most fatalities occur when swimmers exhaust themselves fighting the flow.</p>
