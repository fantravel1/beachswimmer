      <!-- Section 1: The Swim -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="swim-heading">
        <h2 id="swim-heading">The Swim</h2>
        <p>Elafonissi is a wade-and-swim lagoon. You walk across a sandbar through knee-deep turquoise water to reach a small island, and the lagoon on either side is the swim zone. The water is warm, impossibly clear, and the bottom is soft sand with no rocks.</p>
        <p>This is not an ocean swim. It's a calm, warm, shallow-water experience — more like floating in a natural pool. The deepest parts of the lagoon reach chest height. For actual depth swimming, walk to the open beach on the west side of the island, where the water deepens within 20 meters of shore.</p>
        <h3>Best for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Families with young children</li>
          <li>Nervous or beginner swimmers</li>
          <li>People who want to float and wade rather than do laps</li>
          <li>Anyone who values water clarity and beauty over depth</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: Safety Reality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="safety-heading">
        <h2 id="safety-heading">Safety Reality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rip current risk:</strong> Very low in the lagoon. Possible on the open west beach in strong wind.</li>
          <li><strong>Surf behavior:</strong> Lagoon is nearly flat. Open side can have light surf with westerly wind.</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> No rocks, no sea urchins in the lagoon zone. Occasional jellyfish in late summer (rare). The sandbar crossing can have a mild current when wind is up.</li>
          <li><strong>Lifeguards:</strong> Present during summer season (June–September).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall safety: <strong>high</strong>. This is one of the safest beach swims in Greece.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 3: Entry Type -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="entry-heading">
        <h2 id="entry-heading">Entry Type</h2>
        <p><strong>Sand entry.</strong> Soft, fine sand — some areas with a pink tint from crushed shells. Perfectly flat, no rocks, no drop-offs. You can walk in gradually for 100+ meters before the water reaches waist height.</p>
        <p>Difficulty: <strong>Beginner-friendly.</strong> No special footwear needed. Safe for toddlers and elderly swimmers.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Depth Quality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="depth-heading">
        <h2 id="depth-heading">Depth Quality</h2>
        <p>The lagoon is shallow — knee to chest deep across most of the area. This is a wading and floating swim, not a deep-water swim.</p>
        <p>For deeper swimming, the open beach on the island's west side reaches swimmable depth (1.5m+) within 15–20 meters of shore. The transition is smooth sand, no sudden drops.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 5: Temperature & Comfort -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="temp-heading">
        <h2 id="temp-heading">Temperature and Comfort</h2>
        <table class="condition-table">
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Month</th><th>Water Temp</th><th>Comfort</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>May</td><td>19–21°C</td><td>Cool but swimmable, refreshing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>June</td><td>22–24°C</td><td>Warm and comfortable</td></tr>
            <tr><td>July</td><td>24–26°C</td><td>Warm, lagoon heats above ambient</td></tr>
            <tr><td>August</td><td>25–27°C</td><td>Warmest — lagoon can feel bath-like</td></tr>
            <tr><td>September</td><td>24–25°C</td><td>Warm, excellent</td></tr>
            <tr><td>October</td><td>22–23°C</td><td>Still warm, shorter days</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The shallow lagoon warms faster than open water — on calm August days, it feels like a warm bath. No cold shock risk at any time during swim season.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 6: Swim Weather -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="weather-heading">
        <h2 id="weather-heading">Swim Weather</h2>
        <p>This is where Elafonissi's swim quality lives or dies. Wind is the main variable.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wind direction:</strong> Elafonissi faces west-southwest. Westerly and northwesterly winds kick up chop in the lagoon and can make the sandbar crossing uncomfortable. Easterly and northerly winds leave the lagoon glass-flat.</li>
          <li><strong>Swell:</strong> The lagoon is protected from open-ocean swell by the island. The open west beach catches swell directly — check forecasts if you want to swim there.</li>
          <li><strong>Tide:</strong> Minimal tidal range in the Mediterranean (&lt;30cm). Not a factor.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clearest on calm, windless mornings. Wind stirs up fine sand in the lagoon, reducing visibility from crystal to milky-turquoise.</li>
          <li><strong>Rain runoff:</strong> The area is dry — minimal runoff impact. After rare heavy rain, turbidity clears within hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key rule:</strong> Check wind forecasts before driving to Elafonissi. On windy days, the lagoon loses its magic. On calm days, it's one of the best swims on Earth.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 7: Best Months -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="months-heading">
        <h2 id="months-heading">Best Months to Swim</h2>
        <p><strong>Late May through mid-June</strong> and <strong>September</strong> are the best windows. Warm water, low wind probability, manageable crowds. July and August deliver the warmest water but extreme crowding — arrive before 9am or skip those months entirely.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 8: Crowding & Vibe -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="crowd-heading">
        <h2 id="crowd-heading">Crowding and Vibe</h2>
        <p>Elafonissi is famous, and it shows. In July and August, the main beach fills by 10am. The parking lot overflows. Tour buses arrive by 11am.</p>
        <p>The fix: walk to the island side (south), where it's significantly less crowded. Or visit in June or September, when you can have stretches of lagoon to yourself.</p>
        <p><strong>Vibe:</strong> Families, couples, day-trippers. Not a party beach. Not a luxury scene. People come to wade and float. The atmosphere is calm and natural.</p>
        <p><strong>Family friendly:</strong> Yes — one of the most family-friendly swims in Greece.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 9: Snorkel Potential -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="snorkel-heading">
        <h2 id="snorkel-heading">Snorkel Potential</h2>
        <p>Limited. The lagoon is too shallow for meaningful snorkeling. The open west beach has some fish and sea grass, but visibility depends on conditions. For snorkeling in west Crete, Falassarna or Kedrodasos are better options.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Excellent when calm, but the lagoon is only knee-deep</li>
          <li><strong>Fish presence:</strong> Minimal in the lagoon; moderate on the island's south side</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> None in the lagoon</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Beginner or nervous swimmers</li>
          <li>People who value beauty and calm over athletic swimming</li>
          <li>Photographers and nature lovers</li>
          <li>Warm-water waders and floaters</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Lap swimmers or long-distance swimmers (too shallow)</li>
          <li>Snorkelers (limited depth and marine life)</li>

      <!-- Section 11: Getting There -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="getting-heading">
        <h2 id="getting-heading">Getting There</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nearest airport:</strong> Chania (CHQ) — 75 km, approximately 1.5-hour drive</li>
          <li><strong>Drive from Chania:</strong> Winding mountain road through Topolia Gorge. Scenic but slow. No shortcuts.</li>
          <li><strong>Public transport:</strong> KTEL bus from Chania runs daily in summer (1 departure morning, 1 return afternoon). Limited schedule — check times.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Free lot fills by 10am in peak season. Overflow along the road. Arrive early.</li>
          <li><strong>From Heraklion (HER):</strong> 3+ hours by car. Chania is the correct airport choice.</li>

      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="stay-heading">
        <h2 id="stay-heading">Where to Stay (Swim-First)</h2>
        <p>There are no hotels at Elafonissi itself. The nearest accommodation options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Elafonissi village (2 km):</strong> A few small guesthouses. Walk or short drive to the beach. Simple, quiet.</li>
          <li><strong>Chrysoskalitissa area (5 km):</strong> Rooms near the monastery with views. Good base for early morning arrivals.</li>
          <li><strong>Paleochora (40 min drive):</strong> Larger town with more accommodation options, restaurants, and a harbor. A good base for exploring multiple west Crete beaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Kissamos / Kastelli (1 hr drive):</strong> Convenient if also visiting Balos lagoon. More infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Swim-first tip:</strong> Stay within 15 minutes to arrive before 9am in high season. The early swimmer gets the calm lagoon.</p>

        <h2 id="faq-heading">Elafonissi Swimming FAQ</h2>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is Elafonissi Beach good for swimming?</summary>
          <p>Elafonissi is one of the best swimming beaches in the Mediterranean. The lagoon has knee-deep turquoise water with a soft sand bottom, no rocks, and almost no current. You can wade 200 meters to a small island. SwimScore™: 92/100.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is Elafonissi Beach safe for children?</summary>
          <p>Yes. The lagoon side is extremely shallow (knee to waist deep for 100+ meters), with soft sand, no rocks, and minimal current. It is one of the safest beach swims in Greece for young children. Lifeguards are present during summer season.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is the best month to visit Elafonissi?</summary>
          <p>Late May to mid-June and September are the best months. Water is warm (22–25°C), the lagoon is calm, and crowds are manageable. July and August are warm but extremely crowded — arrive before 9am.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Why is the sand pink at Elafonissi?</summary>
          <p>The pink color comes from crushed shells of tiny marine organisms called foraminifera. The pink tint is most visible when the sand is wet, especially in the lagoon area and along the sandbar to the island.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can you swim from Elafonissi beach to the island?</summary>
          <p>You wade rather than swim. The sandbar connecting the beach to the island is ankle to knee deep in calm conditions. In windy weather, the water over the sandbar can reach waist height with a mild current — still walkable for adults.</p>
