      <!-- Section 1: The Swim -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="swim-heading">
        <h2 id="swim-heading">The Swim</h2>
        <p>Balos is a vast turquoise lagoon backing a long white-sand beach, with mountains rising dramatically behind. The water is warm, clear, and shallow — you can walk waist-deep for 200+ meters. The lagoon opens to the northwest, with Gramvoussa Island visible across the water.</p>
        <p>This is a wade-and-float experience, not a deep-water swim. The lagoon reaches its deepest point (3–4 meters) only in the center. For swimmers wanting actual depth, the outer edges near the island entrance drop to 5–6 meters within 100 meters of shore.</p>
        <h3>Best for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Families with children</li>
          <li>Swimmers who value warmth and calm over depth</li>
          <li>Photographers and sunset lovers</li>
          <li>Anyone wanting an iconic Mediterranean lagoon experience</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: Safety Reality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="safety-heading">
        <h2 id="safety-heading">Safety Reality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rip current risk:</strong> Very low in the shallow lagoon. The opening to the sea can have mild currents in windy conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Surf behavior:</strong> Lagoon is nearly flat. The open side can develop light swell with westerly wind.</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> No rocks, no sea urchins in the main lagoon. Occasional jellyfish in late August (rare). Watch for boats and tour groups in peak season.</li>
          <li><strong>Lifeguards:</strong> Present during summer season (June–September) in the main beach area.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall safety: <strong>high</strong>. This is one of the safest beach swims in Crete.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 3: Entry Type -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="entry-heading">
        <h2 id="entry-heading">Entry Type</h2>
        <p><strong>Sand entry.</strong> Fine white sand — perfectly flat and gradual. You can walk in waist-deep for 100+ meters without reaching chest height. No rocks, no sudden drop-offs, no special footwear needed.</p>
        <p>Difficulty: <strong>Beginner-friendly.</strong> Safe for toddlers, elderly swimmers, and anyone nervous about sudden depth changes.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Depth Quality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="depth-heading">
        <h2 id="depth-heading">Depth Quality</h2>
        <p>The lagoon is predominantly shallow — knee to chest deep across most of the area. This is a wading and floating experience. For deeper swimming, swim toward the western opening where the lagoon transitions to open water and depth increases gradually.</p>
        <p>Smooth sand throughout — good for all swimmers, but not ideal for competitive lap swimming.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 5: Temperature & Comfort -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="temp-heading">
        <h2 id="temp-heading">Temperature and Comfort</h2>
        <table class="condition-table">
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Month</th><th>Water Temp</th><th>Comfort</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>May</td><td>20–22°C</td><td>Cool but swimmable</td></tr>
            <tr><td>June</td><td>23–25°C</td><td>Warm and comfortable</td></tr>
            <tr><td>July</td><td>25–27°C</td><td>Warm, lagoon heats quickly</td></tr>
            <tr><td>August</td><td>26–28°C</td><td>Warmest — lagoon feels bath-like</td></tr>
            <tr><td>September</td><td>24–26°C</td><td>Warm, excellent</td></tr>
            <tr><td>October</td><td>22–24°C</td><td>Still warm, good conditions</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The shallow water heats rapidly — on calm August days, the lagoon feels like a warm bath. No cold shock at any point during swim season.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 6: Swim Weather -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="weather-heading">
        <h2 id="weather-heading">Swim Weather</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wind direction:</strong> Balos opens northwest. Westerly and northwesterly winds can push chop into the lagoon. Easterly and southeasterly winds leave it glass-flat.</li>
          <li><strong>Swell:</strong> The lagoon is partly protected by the landscape. Large Atlantic swell occasionally wraps around in winter, but this is a summer destination.</li>
          <li><strong>Tide:</strong> Minimal tidal range (&lt;30cm). Not a factor.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Excellent on calm mornings. Wind stirs fine sand, reducing visibility from crystal to milky-blue.</li>
          <li><strong>Rain runoff:</strong> The area is semi-arid. Minimal impact. Clarity recovers quickly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key rule:</strong> Early morning swims are calmest and clearest. Plan to arrive by 8am in peak season to beat crowds and wind.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 7: Best Months -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="months-heading">
        <h2 id="months-heading">Best Months to Swim</h2>
        <p><strong>June and September</strong> are ideal. Warm water, favorable wind patterns, and lower crowds than July-August. Late May can work if you tolerate slightly cooler water (20–22°C).</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 8: Crowding & Vibe -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="crowd-heading">
        <h2 id="crowd-heading">Crowding and Vibe</h2>
        <p>Balos is famous and accessible, so it attracts crowds. July and August bring tour buses, boat tours, and day-trippers. The beach fills by 10am. Arriving before 9am is essential in peak season.</p>
        <p>The lagoon is large enough that crowds disperse — walk to the far ends to find quieter patches. June and September are significantly less crowded.</p>
        <p><strong>Vibe:</strong> Family-oriented, touristy in peak season, naturally beautiful. Mix of tourists, families, and day-trippers. The iconic scenery draws photographers and sunset watchers.</p>
        <p><strong>Family friendly:</strong> Yes — excellent for families.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 9: Snorkel Potential -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="snorkel-heading">
        <h2 id="snorkel-heading">Snorkel Potential</h2>
        <p>Limited. The lagoon is too shallow for snorkeling in most areas (you'll see bottom in 1–2 meters everywhere). For snorkeling, swim toward the deeper western opening or take a boat to explore around Gramvoussa Island.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Excellent in shallow areas, but depth is minimal</li>
          <li><strong>Fish presence:</strong> Few in the lagoon; more at deeper edges and around the island</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> None in the shallow lagoon</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 11: Getting There -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="getting-heading">
        <h2 id="getting-heading">Getting There</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nearest airport:</strong> Chania (CHQ) — 60 km, approximately 1.5-hour drive</li>
          <li><strong>Drive from Chania:</strong> Northwest toward Kaliviani, then follow signs to Balos. Winding mountain road with unpaved sections (passable by standard car). Allow 1.5 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Boat tours:</strong> Daily boat trips from Kissamos harbor (30 minutes by boat). Good option if you don't want to drive the mountain road.</li>
          <li><strong>Public transport:</strong> Limited. Summer minibus service from Chania to Kaliviani, but not to the beach itself.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Large free lot, but fills by 10am in July–August. Overflow parking along the road.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 12: Where to Stay -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="stay-heading">
        <h2 id="stay-heading">Where to Stay (Swim-First)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kaliviani (10 km):</strong> Small village on the way to Balos. Limited accommodation. Peaceful base.</li>
          <li><strong>Kissamos / Kastelli (20 km):</strong> Harbor town with restaurants, shops, and more accommodation options. Good base for boat access to Balos.</li>
          <li><strong>Paleochora (1 hour):</strong> Larger town with more amenities. Good for exploring multiple west Crete beaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Chania (1.5 hours):</strong> Major city with extensive accommodation and dining. Consider a day trip to Balos.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Swim-first tip:</strong> Kissamos offers the best balance — close enough for early arrival, with boat tour alternatives and other beach options nearby.</p>
