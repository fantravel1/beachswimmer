      <!-- Section 1: The Swim -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="swim-heading">
        <h2 id="swim-heading">The Swim</h2>
        <p>Palombaggia is iconic for a reason. Pink sand, turquoise water, and a dramatic granite mountain backdrop create one of the Mediterranean's most visually stunning beaches. The water is clear, warm in summer, and surprisingly swimmable despite its famous beauty.</p>
        <p>The swim itself is a mix of shallow wading and deeper swimming. The center of the beach has a sandbar that extends out 50+ meters, creating a wide zone of knee-to-waist-deep water. Beyond the sandbar, the bottom drops gradually, reaching 3–4 meters within 100 meters of shore.</p>
        <h3>Best for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Photographers and aesthetes seeking the most beautiful swim</li>
          <li>Swimmers who value scenic experience</li>
          <li>Families wanting a famous, stunning destination</li>
          <li>Anyone wanting a warm-water Mediterranean classic</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: Safety Reality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="safety-heading">
        <h2 id="safety-heading">Safety Reality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rip current risk:</strong> Low in calm conditions. Winds from the south or southeast can create currents along the shore — avoid during rough sea forecasts.</li>
          <li><strong>Surf behavior:</strong> The beach faces southeast. Summer conditions are typically calm. Swell from south-southwest storms can wrap around the peninsula in winter/spring.</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Mostly sand, but some rocks at the edges of the cove. Granite boulders in the water — watch your footing. Sea urchins possible on rocks.</li>
          <li><strong>Lifeguards:</strong> None. This is a natural beach. Swim within your ability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall safety: <strong>good in calm conditions, moderate in rough seas</strong>.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 3: Entry Type -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="entry-heading">
        <h2 id="entry-heading">Entry Type</h2>
        <p><strong>Sand entry</strong> in the center. The famous pink sand is fine and pleasant. Gradual depth across the sandbar. Granite boulders and rocks at the sides — watch your feet.</p>
        <p>Difficulty: <strong>Easy in the center, moderate at the edges.</strong> The center is beginner-friendly; rocky areas require care.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Depth Quality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="depth-heading">
        <h2 id="depth-heading">Depth Quality</h2>
        <p>A long sandbar extends 50+ meters from shore, creating knee-to-waist-deep water across much of the beach. Beyond the sandbar, depth increases gradually — chest-deep at 60–70 meters, with 3–4 meters depth available within 100 meters of the center beach.</p>
        <p>Good for families who want shallow access and swimmers who want deeper water nearby.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 5: Temperature & Comfort -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="temp-heading">
        <h2 id="temp-heading">Temperature and Comfort</h2>
        <table class="condition-table">
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Month</th><th>Water Temp</th><th>Comfort</th></tr>
          </thead>

            <tr><td>April</td><td>15–17°C</td><td>Cold, experienced swimmers only</td></tr>
            <tr><td>May</td><td>18–20°C</td><td>Cool but swimmable</td></tr>
            <tr><td>June</td><td>20–22°C</td><td>Comfortable, warm enough</td></tr>

            <tr><td>September</td><td>22–24°C</td><td>Warm and pleasant</td></tr>
            <tr><td>October</td><td>20–21°C</td><td>Cool but swimmable</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Corsica's water is cooler than Greece or Mallorca due to deeper open-sea influences. Peak comfort is June–September.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 6: Swim Weather -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="weather-heading">
        <h2 id="weather-heading">Swim Weather</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wind direction:</strong> Palombaggia faces southeast. Northwesterly winds (common) blow along the shore with minimal impact. Strong southeasterly winds push swell directly in — avoid on these days.</li>
          <li><strong>Swell:</strong> The open Tyrrhenian Sea means Atlantic swell can wrap around. Summer is calmer; spring and winter can bring significant swell.</li>
          <li><strong>Tide:</strong> Negligible Mediterranean tidal range. Not a factor.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Excellent, typically 10–15 meters visibility. Wind doesn't impact clarity as much as at lagoon beaches — the open water self-corrects.</li>
          <li><strong>Rain runoff:</strong> Minimal. The granite terrain drains quickly. Rain doesn't significantly reduce visibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key rule:</strong> Check sea state forecasts before visiting. Summer offers the most reliable calm conditions. Avoid during south-southeast storm forecasts.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 7: Best Months -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="months-heading">
        <h2 id="months-heading">Best Months to Swim</h2>
        <p><strong>June and September</strong> offer the ideal window. Water is warm (20–24°C), swell is minimal, and crowds are moderate. July and August are warmest (24–26°C) but busiest. May and October are possible but cooler.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 8: Crowding & Vibe -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="crowd-heading">
        <h2 id="crowd-heading">Crowding and Vibe</h2>
        <p>Palombaggia is Corsica's most famous beach, so it attracts crowds. July and August fill the beach with tourists and day-trippers. The large beach disperses crowds somewhat — walk to either end for quieter spots. Weekday mornings are calmer than weekends.</p>
        <p>June and September are significantly less crowded while still offering warm water.</p>
        <p><strong>Vibe:</strong> Mix of tourists, photographers, and swimmers. The iconic scenery draws people expecting beauty and a good Instagram shot. Mix of families, couples, and sun-seekers. Relatively commercial compared to hidden coves, but not overdeveloped.</p>
        <p><strong>Family friendly:</strong> Yes. The long sandbar and shallow water make it safe for children.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 9: Snorkel Potential -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="snorkel-heading">
        <h2 id="snorkel-heading">Snorkel Potential</h2>
        <p>Moderate. The water is clear and you'll see fish, but the sandbar is too shallow for snorkeling. For better snorkeling, swim to the rocky edges or drive to nearby Cala di Mezzaluna or other Corsican coves.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> 10–15 meters, excellent for the Mediterranean</li>
          <li><strong>Fish presence:</strong> Few in the sandy center, more along rocky edges</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Rocks and sea urchins at the edges</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 11: Getting There -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="getting-heading">
        <h2 id="getting-heading">Getting There</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nearest airport:</strong> Bastia (BIA) — 130 km north, approximately 2.5-hour drive. Or Ajaccio (AJU) — 150 km west, approximately 3-hour drive.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive from Bastia:</strong> South through Corsica toward Porto-Vecchio. The road winds through mountains but is scenic and well-maintained.</li>
          <li><strong>Ferry option:</strong> Ferry from France (Nice, Toulon) to Bastia or Ajaccio, then drive.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Large paid lot at Palombaggia. Fills on summer weekends — arrive early or visit weekdays.</li>
          <li><strong>Public transport:</strong> Limited. Car rental is almost essential for Corsica beach access.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Section 12: Where to Stay -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="stay-heading">
        <h2 id="stay-heading">Where to Stay (Swim-First)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Porto-Vecchio (8 km):</strong> Corsica's second-largest town with accommodation, restaurants, and a marina. Good base for exploring southeast Corsica beaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Bonifacio (20 km):</strong> Famous clifftop town with dramatic scenery. Accommodation ranges from budget to luxury. 25-minute drive to Palombaggia.</li>
          <li><strong>Cala di Mezzaluna area (5 km):</strong> Smaller coves nearby. Less developed than Porto-Vecchio.</li>
          <li><strong>Nearby resorts:</strong> Several holiday resorts near Palombaggia itself, though they tend toward luxury pricing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Swim-first tip:</strong> Porto-Vecchio is the best balance of amenities and access. Close enough for early arrival, with restaurants and culture for non-swimming days.</p>
