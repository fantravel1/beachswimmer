      <!-- Section 1: The Swim -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="swim-heading">
        <h2 id="swim-heading">The Swim</h2>
        <p>Cala Varques is a sheltered east-coast cove backed by pine-covered limestone cliffs. The water is transparent — you see the sandy bottom 5 meters down. The cove opens to the east, protected from prevailing winds, and stays calm most days.</p>
        <p>The swim is a mix: a sandy central beach for easy entry, rocky edges for snorkeling, and dramatic cliff faces with underwater cave openings that experienced swimmers can explore. The water deepens gradually in the center and drops faster along the cliff walls.</p>
        <h3>Best for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Snorkel swimmers who want clear water and marine life</li>
          <li>Intermediate swimmers who enjoy exploring</li>
          <li>Couples and friends looking for a natural, uncommercial beach</li>
          <li>Swimmers who value water clarity above all else</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: Safety Reality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="safety-heading">
        <h2 id="safety-heading">Safety Reality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rip current risk:</strong> Low. The cove is sheltered and small. Minimal current in normal conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Surf behavior:</strong> Calm in the cove. Easterly wind can push light chop in, but the cliffs block most swell.</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Rocky edges — watch your feet at the sides. Sea urchins present on submerged rocks. Cave entries can have surge — do not enter caves unless you are experienced and conditions are flat.</li>
          <li><strong>Lifeguards:</strong> None. This is an undeveloped beach. Swim within your ability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall safety: <strong>good for the central swim area, moderate at the rocky edges and caves</strong>.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 3: Entry Type -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="entry-heading">
        <h2 id="entry-heading">Entry Type</h2>
        <p><strong>Sand entry</strong> in the center of the cove. Fine white sand, gradual depth, no rocks underfoot. At the edges, rocky entry with some submerged boulders — water shoes recommended if you plan to snorkel from the sides.</p>
        <p>Difficulty: <strong>Easy in the center, moderate at the edges.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Depth Quality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="depth-heading">
        <h2 id="depth-heading">Depth Quality</h2>
        <p>Gradual depth from the sand entry — waist-deep at 10 meters, chest-deep at 20 meters. The center of the cove reaches 4–5 meters at its deepest. Along the cliff walls, depth drops to 6–8 meters quickly, which is where the snorkeling and cave entries happen.</p>
        <p>Good for real swimming within 30 meters of shore.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 6: Swim Weather -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="weather-heading">
        <h2 id="weather-heading">Swim Weather</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wind direction:</strong> The cove faces east. Westerly and northwesterly winds (the most common) leave the cove perfectly calm. Strong easterly or southeasterly wind pushes swell directly in — avoid on these days.</li>
          <li><strong>Swell:</strong> The cliff walls provide significant shelter. Only direct east swell reaches the beach. Most days are flat.</li>
          <li><strong>Tide:</strong> Negligible Mediterranean tidal range. Not a factor.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Exceptional year-round. Best on calm mornings. After easterly wind, fine sand can reduce visibility for a few hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Rain runoff:</strong> Minimal — dry limestone terrain. Clarity recovers quickly after rain.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 7: Best Months -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="months-heading">
        <h2 id="months-heading">Best Months to Swim</h2>
        <p><strong>June and September</strong> are the best months. Warm water, excellent clarity, uncrowded. July and August are warmer but the beach gets busy by late morning — the 15-minute walk filters out some crowds, but not all.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 8: Crowding & Vibe -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="crowd-heading">
        <h2 id="crowd-heading">Crowding and Vibe</h2>
        <p>The walk-in access limits crowds compared to roadside calas. Mornings are quiet; by noon in July and August, the beach fills up. Weekends are busier than weekdays.</p>
        <p><strong>Vibe:</strong> Natural, adventurous, local. No sunbed rentals, no bars. Swimmers, snorkelers, and cliff-divers. Pine-shaded areas for rest. Bring your own food and water.</p>
        <p><strong>Family friendly:</strong> Moderate. The center swim is safe for families, but the lack of facilities and 15-minute walk make it less convenient for young children.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 9: Snorkel Potential -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="snorkel-heading">
        <h2 id="snorkel-heading">Snorkel Potential</h2>
        <p>Excellent. Cala Varques is one of the best snorkel swims in Mallorca.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> 15–25 meters on calm days. Among the best in the Balearics.</li>
          <li><strong>Fish presence:</strong> Good — sea bream, wrasse, damselfish, and octopus along the rocky edges. Posidonia sea grass meadows outside the cove.</li>
          <li><strong>Caves:</strong> Several underwater and semi-submerged cave openings along the south cliff. Explore only in flat conditions with a buddy.</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Sea urchins on rocks. Do not touch the cliff face while snorkeling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bring your own mask and snorkel — no rental available.</p>

        <h3>Not ideal for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Families with very young children (no facilities, walk required)</li>
          <li>Swimmers who need lifeguard coverage</li>
          <li>Anyone unable to walk 15 minutes on an unpaved path</li>
          <li>People wanting beach bars and sunbed service</li>

      <!-- Section 11: Getting There -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="getting-heading">
        <h2 id="getting-heading">Getting There</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nearest airport:</strong> Palma de Mallorca (PMI) — 65 km, approximately 1-hour drive</li>
          <li><strong>Drive from Palma:</strong> Take the Ma-15 east toward Manacor, then south toward Cales de Mallorca. Parking area is signposted.</li>
          <li><strong>Walk:</strong> 15 minutes flat, unpaved path from the parking area. Easy walk, no climbing.</li>
          <li><strong>Public transport:</strong> No direct bus. Car or bicycle access only.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Free roadside parking. Fills on summer weekends — arrive before 10am.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Section 12: Where to Stay -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="stay-heading">
        <h2 id="stay-heading">Where to Stay (Swim-First)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Porto Cristo (15 min drive):</strong> Small harbor town with restaurants, shops, and affordable accommodation. Good base for east coast cala hopping.</li>
          <li><strong>Manacor (20 min drive):</strong> Mallorca's second city. More options, less tourist pricing. Inland but central for east coast beaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Cales de Mallorca (10 min drive):</strong> Resort area closest to Cala Varques. Convenient but more tourist-oriented.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Swim-first tip:</strong> Porto Cristo is the best base — close to Cala Varques, Cala Mondragó, and Cala Romantica, giving you multiple swim options each day.</p>
