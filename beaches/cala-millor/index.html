      <!-- Section 1: The Swim -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="swim-heading">
        <h2 id="swim-heading">The Swim</h2>
        <p>Cala Millor is a long, golden-sand beach with turquoise water and exceptionally gradual entry. You can walk knee-deep for 100+ meters without reaching chest height. The water is warm and clear, with minimal current and a sandy bottom throughout.</p>
        <p>This is primarily a shallow-water, family-oriented beach. For swimmers wanting depth, the center of the bay reaches 3–4 meters within 50 meters of shore. The wider bay provides real swimming area without feeling exposed or dangerous.</p>
        <h3>Best for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Families with young children</li>
          <li>Beginner and nervous swimmers</li>
          <li>Warm-water floaters and waders</li>
          <li>Anyone wanting beach amenities and comfort</li>
          <li>Swimmers with mobility concerns</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: Safety Reality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="safety-heading">
        <h2 id="safety-heading">Safety Reality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rip current risk:</strong> Very low. The wide bay dissipates energy, and currents are minimal.</li>
          <li><strong>Surf behavior:</strong> Calm in normal conditions. The orientation toward the southeast provides shelter from Atlantic swell.</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> No rocks, no sea urchins in the main beach area. Sandy throughout.</li>
          <li><strong>Lifeguards:</strong> Present year-round — one of Mallorca's few beaches with year-round lifeguard coverage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall safety: <strong>very high</strong>. One of Mallorca's safest and best-patrolled beaches.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 3: Entry Type -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="entry-heading">
        <h2 id="entry-heading">Entry Type</h2>
        <p><strong>Sand entry.</strong> Fine golden sand, perfectly flat and incredibly gradual. You can walk out knee-deep for 100+ meters. No rocks, no sudden drop-offs, no special footwear needed.</p>
        <p>Difficulty: <strong>Beginner-friendly.</strong> Safe for toddlers, elderly swimmers, anyone with mobility concerns, and the most nervous swimmers.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Depth Quality -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="depth-heading">
        <h2 id="depth-heading">Depth Quality</h2>
        <p>Exceptionally gradual. The beach maintains shallow water (waist-deep or less) for 100+ meters. The center of the bay reaches 3–4 meters within 50–60 meters of shore, providing real swimming depth while maintaining easy access to shallows.</p>
        <p>Ideal for all swimming levels — children can play in shallows while adults swim deeper without loss of sight.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 5: Temperature & Comfort -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="temp-heading">

        <table class="condition-table">

            <tr><td>September</td><td>24–26°C</td><td>Warm, excellent clarity</td></tr>
            <tr><td>October</td><td>22–23°C</td><td>Still warm</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The shallow water and south-facing orientation warm quickly. Year-round swimming possible, but peak comfort is May–October.</p>

      <!-- Section 6: Swim Weather -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="weather-heading">
        <h2 id="weather-heading">Swim Weather</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wind direction:</strong> Cala Millor faces southeast. Westerly and northwesterly winds (most common) leave the beach calm. Strong easterly winds can push swell in — rare.</li>
          <li><strong>Swell:</strong> Well-protected from Atlantic swell due to orientation. Most swells pass to the north or south.</li>
          <li><strong>Tide:</strong> Negligible Mediterranean tidal range. Not a factor.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Good year-round. Best on calm, windless mornings. Wind stirs fine sand, reducing visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Rain runoff:</strong> Minimal in the dry east-coast climate. Clarity recovers quickly after rain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key rule:</strong> Cala Millor is consistent and forgiving — one of the calmest beaches in Mallorca year-round.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 7: Best Months -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="months-heading">
        <h2 id="months-heading">Best Months to Swim</h2>
        <p><strong>May, June, and September</strong> are ideal — warm water, calm seas, and moderate crowds. July and August are warmest but busiest. April and October are still swimmable but cooler.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 8: Crowding & Vibe -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="crowd-heading">
        <h2 id="crowd-heading">Crowding and Vibe</h2>
        <p>Cala Millor is popular and accessible, so it fills with tourists. July and August bring peak crowds — the beach and promenade are busy throughout the day. Arriving early is helpful but less critical than at hidden coves.</p>
        <p>The long beach (over 1 km) means crowds spread out. Walk to either end for quieter patches. June and September are noticeably less crowded.</p>
        <p><strong>Vibe:</strong> Family-friendly, touristy, developed. Mix of vacationing families, couples, and day-trippers. Water sports, sunbed rentals, bars, and restaurants line the shore. The atmosphere is lively and comfortable.</p>
        <p><strong>Family friendly:</strong> Yes — excellent for families.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 9: Snorkel Potential -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="snorkel-heading">
        <h2 id="snorkel-heading">Snorkel Potential</h2>
        <p>Limited. The main beach is sandy with minimal marine life. For snorkeling, swim toward the rocky outer edges of the bay or drive to Cala Varques or other east-coast calas.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Good in the sandy areas, but limited underwater interest</li>
          <li><strong>Fish presence:</strong> Few in the sandy center; more at outer edges and rocks</li>
          <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> None in the main beach area</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Families with young children</li>
          <li>Beginners and nervous swimmers</li>
          <li>Travelers wanting beach amenities and comfort</li>
          <li>Swimmers seeking year-round access and lifeguard presence</li>

        <h3>Not ideal for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Snorkelers (sandy, not much marine life)</li>
          <li>Crowd-averse swimmers in July–August</li>
          <li>Swimmers seeking natural, undeveloped beaches</li>
          <li>Deep-water swimmers wanting immediate depth</li>

      <!-- Section 11: Getting There -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="getting-heading">
        <h2 id="getting-heading">Getting There</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nearest airport:</strong> Palma de Mallorca (PMI) — 75 km, approximately 1.5-hour drive</li>
          <li><strong>Drive from Palma:</strong> Take the Ma-15 east toward Manacor and beyond. Signs to Cala Millor are clear. Straightforward drive on main roads.</li>
          <li><strong>Public transport:</strong> Buses from Palma to Cala Millor run daily (approximately 2 hours). Good option if you don't want to rent a car.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Large paid lot at the beach entrance. Fills on summer weekends but there is usually overflow parking. Much easier than hidden coves.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 12: Where to Stay -->
      <section class="info-section" aria-labelledby="stay-heading">
        <h2 id="stay-heading">Where to Stay (Swim-First)</h2>
        <p>Cala Millor itself has numerous hotels, apartments, and guesthouses directly on the beach and promenade. Options range from budget to upscale.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>On the beach:</strong> Hotels and apartments with direct beach access. Convenient but can be touristy.</li>
          <li><strong>Cala Millor promenade:</strong> Restaurants, bars, and shops. Walkable to everything.</li>
          <li><strong>Son Servera (5 km inland):</strong> Quieter option with local charm. Short drive to the beach.</li>
          <li><strong>Arta (15 km):</strong> More authentic inland town with access to multiple east-coast beaches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Swim-first tip:</strong> Staying on the beach lets you swim early before crowds arrive. The convenience is worth it for family trips.</p>
