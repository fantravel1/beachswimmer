            <h2>The Swim</h2>
            <p>Myrtos is one of Greece's most visually striking beaches: 2 km of white pebbles with turquoise Ionian water backed by dramatic red-limestone cliffs. The beach is famous for its aesthetic appeal, but swimmers will appreciate the consistently calm conditions, excellent water clarity, and surprisingly good entry for a pebble beach.</p>
            <p>Best swims: May through September. The water warms to 25°C by August. Pebbles are large but comfortable with aqua shoes.</p>

          <div class="feature">
            <h3>Unmatched Visual Drama</h3>
            <p>The 300-meter red cliffs towering directly above the beach create a backdrop that feels almost unreal. Swimming here, you feel simultaneously isolated and observed by the landscape.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature">
            <h3>Consistent Calm</h3>
            <p>Despite being on the Ionian coast, Myrtos rarely experiences significant swells. The beach faces north and is protected by Zakynthos island offshore, creating exceptional swimming conditions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature">
            <h3>Accessible Crowds</h3>
