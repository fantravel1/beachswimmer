        <h2 id="overview-heading">Mallorca Swimming Overview</h2>
        <p>Mallorca's coastline is defined by calas — small, cliff-backed coves with calm, clear water. The east coast has the most sheltered swimming, while the north coast faces bigger swells and wind. The south coast offers long sandy beaches with shallow wading.</p>
        <p>Water visibility regularly exceeds 20 meters in sheltered calas. Entry is typically sand or smooth pebble with gradual depth. Water temperature peaks at 27°C in August.</p>
