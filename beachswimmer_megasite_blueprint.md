## 1) The Big Reframe

**Not All Beaches Are Swimmable**

A beach can be beautiful and still be:

- too rough  
- too cold  
- too rocky  
- too dirty  
- too shallow  
- too dangerous  

BeachSwimmer exists to say:

> **“Yes — you can actually swim here. And it’s incredible.”**

This is the core differentiator.

## 2) Build the SwimScore™ (Your Moat)

Every beach gets a clear, addictive rating:

**SwimScore™ (1–100)**

Based on:

- Water clarity  
- Safety (rips, surf, hazards)  
- Entry ease (sand vs rocks)  
- Depth quality  
- Temperature comfort  
- Crowding  
- Marine life (good vs dangerous)  
- Cleanliness  
- Calmness vs waves (tagged, not judged)

This system makes the site:
- authoritative  
- comparable  
- endlessly shareable

## 3) Separate Beaches by Swim Type (Elite Filtering)

People don’t want the *best* beach.  
They want **their kind of swim**.

**Swim Types:**

- Calm lagoon swims  
- Open ocean swims  
- Big wave swims (advanced only)  
- Snorkel swims  
- Cliff-entry swims  
- Long-distance swims  
- Family swims  
- Cold water swims  
- Warm bathwater swims  

This is where BeachSwimmer becomes truly elite.
