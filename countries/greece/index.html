        <p>Greece has over 13,000 km of coastline, thousands of islands, and some of the clearest water in the Mediterranean. But not every Greek beach is a good swim. Many are rocky, wind-exposed, or too shallow to swim properly.</p>
        <p>BeachSwimmer rates every Greek beach by what matters: <strong>water clarity, safe entry, depth, temperature, and real conditions</strong>. Below are the top swimming regions and beaches, rated by SwimScore™.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is the best month to swim in Greece?</summary>
          <p>June through September offers the warmest water (24–27°C) and calmest conditions. Late June and September are the sweet spot: warm water, fewer crowds, and lighter winds compared to the peak Meltemi season in July and August.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Which Greek island has the best swimming beaches?</summary>
          <p>Crete has the widest variety of swimmable beaches — from the pink-sand lagoon at Elafonissi to the palm-lined bay at Vai. For calm, crystal-clear cove swims, Milos and Koufonisia are hard to beat. For snorkel swims, Zakynthos and Alonissos offer exceptional clarity.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is it safe to swim at Greek beaches?</summary>
          <p>Most Greek beaches are safe for swimming, with calm Mediterranean water and gradual entries. The main risks are wind-generated waves during Meltemi season (July–August), occasional sea urchins on rocky entries, and rare jellyfish. Always check each beach's SwimScore™ safety rating.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is the Meltemi and how does it affect swimming?</summary>
          <p>The Meltemi is a strong northerly wind that blows across the Aegean Sea mainly in July and August. It can make north-facing beaches rough and choppy. South-facing and sheltered coves remain calm. Check wind exposure before choosing a beach during these months.</p>
