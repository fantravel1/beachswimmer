        <p>A beach can be famous and still be too rough, too cold, too rocky, too dirty, or too dangerous to actually swim in. BeachSwimmer exists to tell you the truth: <strong>yes, you can actually swim here — and it's incredible.</strong></p>

        <h2 id="faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is SwimScore™?</summary>
          <p>SwimScore™ is our proprietary 1 to 100 rating system for beach swimming quality. It evaluates water clarity, safety, entry ease, depth quality, temperature comfort, crowding, cleanliness, marine life, and wave conditions to give every beach a single, honest swim rating.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What makes BeachSwimmer different from other beach websites?</summary>
          <p>BeachSwimmer is swimming-first. Most beach sites rank beauty, luxury, or popularity. We rate whether you can actually get in the water, swim safely, and enjoy it. A beach can be famous and still score low if it's too rough, rocky, or dangerous to swim.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How do you determine if a beach is swimmable?</summary>
          <p>A beach is swimmable when a person can reasonably enter, move, float, and enjoy the water. We assess rip current risk, surf behavior, entry conditions, water clarity, depth profile, and seasonal hazards to determine real swimmability.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Are BeachSwimmer ratings updated seasonally?</summary>
          <p>Yes. Swim conditions change with seasons — wind patterns shift, water temperatures change, and clarity varies with rainfall. We update SwimScore™ ratings to reflect the best and worst months for each beach.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I use BeachSwimmer to plan a swimming trip?</summary>
          <p>Every beach page includes nearest airports, drive times, ferry routes, and swim-first accommodation recommendations so you can plan a trip around real swimming, not just hotel pools.</p>
